📝 Learning Points
This project was a great opportunity to practice and reinforce my skills in:
 * Semantic HTML: Using appropriate tags like <header>, <nav>, <aside>, <main>, and <footer> to create a well-structured document.
 * CSS Layout: Mastering Flexbox and CSS Grid for building complex and responsive layouts.
 * Styling with CSS: Using properties like box-shadow, border-radius, and background-image to create a visually appealing interface.
 * Component-based thinking: Breaking down the UI into smaller, manageable components (e.g., sidebar, player, card).
